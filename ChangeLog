2018-03-16 1.0.1 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
        * Make nc_imagecaption_position TYPO3 8.7 compatible.
	* Add field to the correct palette.

2017-04-02 1.0.0 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Created this extension to use EXT:css_styled_content with Image Caption Alignment on TYPO3 7.6 LTS,
		without having to fall back onto EXT:compatibility6.

		Note:
			tt_content.imagecaption_position is a TYPO3 7 EXT:css_styled_content feature.
			The core team made a mistake by moving it into EXT:compatibility6.
			The field should instead have been moved / be moved into EXT:css_styled_content.
